GoMommy

Okay so go mommy. I need to do stuff that will make difference
Things that looks large in size but are actually ain't shit

Here's a summary of this project
I will design a drag and drop website builder. We will drag elements from sidepane, create components, then using these components, create a whole website. Add plugins for dynamicness then. When completed, save it for later access. Also if you like it way too much, publish it to theme marketplace.
